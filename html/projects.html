	<ul>
		<li><b><a class="link" href="https://stratasource.org/">Strata Source:</a></b> One of four engine maintainers and the Linux port maintainer.<br>
		I help manage our team of ~20 programmers, do code review, general development/bug fixing and some CI/CD work.<br>
		Strata Source is the game engine behind both Momentum Mod and Portal 2: Community Edition.</li>
		<li><b><a class="link" href="https://portal2communityedition.com/">Portal 2: Community Edition:</a></b> Project co-lead and game engine programmer.<br>
		I help manage and lead a team of ~24 artists, level designers and programmers.<br>
		My responsibilities include: help run weekly meetings, manage issue trackers, manage deployments,<br>
		design and implement new features, maintain the Linux port and much more.</li>
		<li><b><a class="link" href="https://momentum-mod.org/">Momentum Mod:</a></b> Engine programmer with an emphasis on Linux.<br>
		Most of the work I do for Momentum Mod is through contributions to Strata Source.</li>
